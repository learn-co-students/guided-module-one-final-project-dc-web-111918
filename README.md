PROCRASTINATION NATION

Joint Project with Jonnel Benjamin and Rachel Novick

Procastination nation is a Command Line Application that allows you to better choose a great movie to watch during your free time. The application boots up with a fun ASCII graphic of the app's name. The first input the user gives is their name and available free time in minutes. The app then suggests different movies to the user based on the movie's runtime that corresponds to the user's free time. The user may accept or reject each suggestion of movies. Once a user has either chosen a movie, or has rejected every single movie in the list, the app allows the user the ability to view their previously watched movies history.

Install Instructions:
